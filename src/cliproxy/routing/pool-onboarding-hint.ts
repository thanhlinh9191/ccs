/**
 * Pool onboarding hint
 *
 * Fires once (per install, TTY only) when a user has >= 2 native Claude account
 * profiles and has not yet enabled pool routing.  Covers the #1464 use case:
 * existing users with multiple native profiles who have never touched CLIProxy
 * and would miss the 1->2 account-add opt-in prompt.
 *
 * Three hint sites call this module:
 *   1. ccs doctor  (post-checks summary, fires for ALL install types)
 *   2. account-flow launch (print-only, pre-spawn) - unified config only
 *   3. ccs auth create (before spawning Claude for a 2nd+ profile) - unified config only
 *
 * Sites 2 and 3 are gated on hasUnifiedConfig() so that legacy profiles.json-only
 * installs receive the hint exclusively from ccs doctor (site 1).  This ensures
 * once-per-install dismissal semantics for every install type: unified installs
 * dismiss via config.yaml on first show; legacy installs see the hint from
 * doctor only (which is the natural discovery surface for that population).
 *
 * Dismissal: stored in pool_routing.onboarding_hint_dismissed in config.yaml.
 * Reuses the Phase 3 pool_routing schema family - one schema home, no duplicate
 * plumbing.  Legacy installs cannot persist a dismissal without config.yaml;
 * this is intentional - dismissal for legacy users happens via ccs migrate or
 * pool enable (both create config.yaml).
 *
 * TTY contract: non-TTY sessions never print the hint (single line only).
 * The hint is informational only - it never blocks the calling flow.
 *
 * History note: pooled sessions live in the CLIProxy lane, not the native
 * profile's CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR lane.  Transcripts and --continue inventory do
 * NOT follow.  This is stated on the docs page linked in the hint copy.
